#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic designing, developing, deploying and maintaining software systems. Software engineering ensures there is high quality software by following the best practices. it helps improve security and reliability of software systems. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The term software engineering was born in 1968 n a conference n germany. The conference created guidelines and the best practices to be applied in software engineering. It laid foundation for formal methodologies.
The agile manifesto 2001 was published by software development practitioners. It encouraged the use of document driven and heavyweight software development processes.
Structured programming i the 1970s anad 1980s to help make it easy to maintain and understand code. It led to better coding standards and better methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning creating a roadmap for development
analysis identify expected challenges and expectations
design develop and design the system usig database models and ensure security and efficiency.
implementation converrt the design using code using best practices and coding standards.
testing identify and fix the bugs  
deployment release the software including updates and patches. 
maintainence monitor and maintain the software improve it and provide user support.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
the waterfall methodology follows linear and sequential process where the development steps are clearly defined such as planning design and implementation. the methodology is rigid and needs documentation thus difficult to makae chanages one the process starts. Testing is done at the end stages thus may be hampered by many challenges. It is the best methodology for well defined projects 
agile methodologies is iterative and flexible allowing developing software in small steps called sprints. It involves continuous customer feedback and involvement. Unlike in waterfall testing is done in the development process reducing risks and allowing quick changes. Agile method is good for fast paced projects. It prioritizes customer satisfaction 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software engineers is responsible for designing, coding and maintaining software system. Theey use different programming languages to improve performance an ensure compatibility 
quality assurance engineer ensures the software created by software engineer meets the quality standards before release. the test and point out bugs. They work closely with developers to help improve software reliability and user experience.
project manager oversees the development process ensuring it is completed on tim withing scope and budget. they coordinate team activities, mitigate risks and manage resources 
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE is a software application that providees developers tools for writing testing and debugging code.  It include code editor, and compiler with other features such as auto completion and syntax highlighting. An example of an IDE is visual studio code which is used for various programming languages.
version control system is a system that tracks changes in code allowing developers to collaborate and maintain history of modifications. It reduces the risk of losing progress and enables teamwork. an example is Git paire to GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
debugging and troubleshooting code debugging is time consuming. they can use structured debugging approaches. 
keeping up with fast evolving technologie. the software industry introduces new frameworks languages and best practices constantly making it difficult to stay updated. This can be addressed through continuous learning through online learning platforms.
security vulnerabilities in software can lead to severe consequences if not addressed properly. Engineers should follow secure coding practices, conduct regular security audits, and stay informed about the latest cybersecurity threats.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is the first level of testing, where individual components or functions of a program are tested in isolation. Developers write unit tests to validate that small sections of code work correctly. It helps identify bugs early in development and ensures that each module performs as expected.
Integration Testing focuses on verifying that different modules or components of a system work together correctly. This testing ensures that data flows properly between integrated units. For example, in a web application, integration testing might check whether the front-end correctly communicates with the back-end API.
System Testing evaluates the entire software application as a whole to ensure that it meets functional and non-functional requirements. It tests the complete system in an environment similar to production, examining aspects such as performance, security, and usability. 
Acceptance Testing is performed to determine whether the software meets business and user requirements before deployment. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the proces of giving or writing instructions for an AI to give the desireed output. The instruction and examples enable AI to understand a persons intent. The importance of interacting with AI is to have a better response, performance and efficiency.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
tell me about cybersecurity
what are the major principles of cybersecurity and how do they enable organizations to protect themselves?
The statemenrt is clear and specific as it requests for cybesecuriry principles and how they protect organizations from cyber threats. The prompt avoids vagueness and shows the direction or the AI to follow.
